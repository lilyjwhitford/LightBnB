# LightBnB

This project aims to develop a database system and utilize server-side JavaScript to present data retrieved from SQL queries on web pages, with the use of promises. LightBnB offered me the chance to gain further knowledge and develop my skills in PostgreSQL, node-postgres, and SQL, as well as crafting Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs).
